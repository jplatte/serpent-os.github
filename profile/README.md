# Welcome to Serpent OS

This organisation houses all of our core development work on projects like `moss` and `boulder`.

For packaging recipes, you should visit the [snekbook](https://github.com/snekbook) organisation.

At Serpent OS we're not opposed to mixing up technologies, however you'll find that we employ [D](https://dlang.org) for much of our low level and critical tooling, which will not be changing.

For higher stack components, such as web, we're happy to consider splitting for a D backend and ReactJS frontend, for example.
