# Welcome to Serpent OS

This organisation houses all of our core development work on projects like `moss` and `boulder`.

For packaging recipes, you should visit the [snekpit](https://github.com/snekpit) organisation.

## STOP THE PRESS

Our current primary project is the [Blazing Fast](https://github.com/orgs/serpent-os/projects/4) project
where we're rewriting core components in Rust, infra in Go, and decorating the whole thing with an abundance
of Rocket emojis.
